    1/2 cup buttermilk (room temperature)
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract`, 
    preparation: `Preheat the ovens
    Begin by preheating the oven to 350º Fahrenheit.
    
    Prepare cake pans
    Prepare three 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick baking spray or coat well with shortening or butter and flour the pans, taking care to remove all excess flour.
    
    Cream butter and shortening
    In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, you will cream together butter and shortening until light and fluffy with an electric mixer or stand mixer.
    
    Add sugar and eggs per instructions
    Then slowly add sugar one cup at a time to the butter/shortening mixture, making sure to fully incorporate each cup before adding another. Next, add eggs one at a time, making sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding another.
    
    Dry ingredients; Milks
    Get a separate bowl for your dry ingredients and sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Then in a measuring cup, pour milks and vanilla into the measuring cup and whisk together with a fork.
    
    Next, alternately add a small amount of the dry ingredient mixture to butter and shortening mixture, gently stirring after each addition. Then add a small amount of the milk mixture to butter/shortening mixture and gently stir until just combined. Continue alternating between adding small amounts of the dry mixture to the the butter/shortening mixture with adding small amounts of the milk mixture to the butter/shortening mixture,  just gently stirring until combined after the addition of each. Make sure to begin and end with the addition of the dry ingredients.
    
    Final Stir and Scrape the Bowl
    Gently stir all ingredients until well combined. Then, stop the mixer and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl, making sure to that all ingredients are mixed well.
    
    Distribute Cake Batter into Pans
    Next, evenly distribute cake batter between the three 9 inch cake pans and place pans into oven.
    
    Bake the Cake
    Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Please don’t open and close the oven door a lot while the cake is baking as the oven temperature drops each time the door is opened.
    
    Remove from Oven and Cool
    Remove the cakes from the oven when done and allow to cool slightly in cake pans for about 5 minutes. Then gently place the cake layers on a wire rack to finish cooling completely. This is important because cakes left in the cake pans the too long to cool may sweat, making it possible for the cakes to stick to the pans.
    
    Frost the Cake
    Frost your cake with your preferred frosting. I’ve used a double recipe of my Classic Vanilla Buttercream here in these photos.`},

    I always add dry ingredients in three divisions and liquid ingredients in 2 divisions. It is very important to begin and end the additions with the dry ingredients. Do not over mix the batter. As soon as it has no lumps in the batter, pour into the two prepared 9 inch cake pans.
    Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.

    Meanwhile, make the pecan pie filling; in a heavy bottom 3 quart saucepan, whisk together the first 6 ingredients until smooth.
    Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly; boil for 1 minute or until mixture is nice and thick. Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Place a sheet of wax paper directly on the surface to avoid a film from forming. Chill at least 6 hours. (I chill it overnight)
    Assemble the cake by placing the first layer of cake, pecan side up and spreading half the pecan pie filling on it. Repeat with the second layer of cake, and filling, then top with the last layer of cake, pecan side up.
     When cake is assembled, make the glaze. In a heavy bottomed 2 quart saucepan, bring the brown sugar, butter, and milk to a boil over medium heat. Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat.

    1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
    3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
    1/4 cup (50g) packed light brown sugar
    1 large egg, at room temperature
    1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract`, 
    preparation: `Make the cookies: Toss the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
    Using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl as needed. Switch the mixer to medium speed and beat in the granulated sugar and brown sugar until combined. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Turn the mixer off and pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and slowly beat until a dough is formed. Cover the dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Chilling is mandatory.
    Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
    Roll the dough into small balls, 2 teaspoons of slightly chilled dough per ball, and place 12 on each baking sheet. Press down on the balls to slightly flatten as pictured above. Bake each batch for 6-8 minutes. These cookies are small and bake very quickly. They will appear soft when done. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. You’ll make 3-4 batches (38-40 cookies total).
    While the cookies are cooling, make the cream filling: In a small bowl using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and shortening together on high speed until creamy and combined, about 1 minute.
